# Calculator-MIPS-Assembly-Language
This project has been made on MIPS Assembly language MARS simulator. It contains all the basic features which a simple calculator needs to be. In this project we define separate function for every feature. Likewise function for addition, subtraction etc. 
When the program started it gives a message to user for choice which feature user want to perform. Then OS take the user to that function or feature user needs to be perform.

2)	Function For Subtraction
3)	Function For Multiplication
4)	Function For Division
